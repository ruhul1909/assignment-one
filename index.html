            <h1>About Us</h1>
            <p>Our goal since the beginning has been to revolutionize green cooking. For us, green food is not about
                everything being vegetarian, but we want to make it easier, more fun and tastier to eat greener food. We
                want everyone to know how good and easy it is to use our seeds, beans, lentils and vegetables in daily
                cooking.</p>

        <h1>Our Recipies</h1>
        <p>For several years, we at GoGreen have worked with Lantmännen to grow lentils in Sweden.

            Our yellow lentils of the variety Flora thrive in more northern latitudes and are grown on farms in
            southern Sweden. The lens has a darker casing with a bright yellow core and solid shape that fits well
            in everything, from salads to stews.</p>

                <h2>Salad Mix</h2>
                <P> You can use GoGreen Salad Mix as it is, as a snack or lightly roasted in your salad. Feel free to
                    also
                    try chopping the mixture and mixing into the muesli in the morning. </P>

                <h2>Gröna Linser</h2>
                <p>GoGreen Green lentils are good in salads, stews, soups and gratins. The lentils do not need to be
                    soaked,
                    but they get bigger and boil faster with 1-2 hours of soaking. Green Lentils can also be germinated!
